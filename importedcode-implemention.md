### Technical Considerations

1. Depth-Based Optimization
   - Current implementation uses multiple metrics:

     interface ResearchSourceMetrics {
       relevanceScore: number    // Query relevance
       depthLevel: number       // Current depth
       contentQuality: number   // Content assessment
       timeRelevance: number    // Recency factor
       sourceAuthority: number  // Domain authority
     }
     ```
   - Adaptive thresholds:
     ```typescript
     interface ResearchDepthRules {
       minRelevanceForNextDepth: number
       maxSourcesPerDepth: number
       depthTimeoutMs: number
       qualityThreshold: number
     }
     ```

2. Performance Considerations
   - Metrics calculation overhead
   - State management optimization
   - Redis persistence strategy
   - Caching implementation

3. Scalability Planning
