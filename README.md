## ⚡ AI SDK Implementation

### Current Version: AI SDK UI

This version of Morphic uses the AI SDK UI implementation, which is recommended for production use. It provides better streaming performance and more reliable client-side UI updates.

### Previous Version: AI SDK RSC (v0.2.34 and earlier)

The React Server Components (RSC) implementation of AI SDK was used in versions up to [v0.2.34](https://github.com/miurla/morphic/releases/tag/v0.2.34) but is now considered experimental and not recommended for production. If you need to reference the RSC implementation, please check the v0.2.34 release tag.

> Note: v0.2.34 was the final version using RSC implementation before migrating to AI SDK UI.

For more information about choosing between AI SDK UI and RSC, see the [official documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/getting-started/navigating-the-library#when-to-use-ai-sdk-rsc).

## 📦 Open Source vs Cloud Offering

Morphic is open source software available under the Apache-2.0 license.

To maintain sustainable development and provide cloud-ready features, we offer a hosted version of Morphic alongside our open-source offering. The cloud solution makes Morphic accessible to non-technical users and provides additional features while keeping the core functionality open and available for developers.

For our cloud service, visit [morphic.sh](https://morphic.sh).
